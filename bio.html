            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm a passionate web developer with a strong love for all things creative. My journey in the world of web development started when I was just a teenager, and it has been an exciting ride ever since. I specialize in front-end development, where I bring websites to life with stunning designs and smooth user experiences.

            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring and playing Bastketball Keeps calm. I believe that a great website not only functions flawlessly but also captivates users with its visual appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of web development and design, creating digital experiences that leave a lasting impression. Let's connect and collaborate on your next project!
